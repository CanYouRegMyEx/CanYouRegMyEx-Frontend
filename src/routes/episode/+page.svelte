		Roller Coaster Murder Case (ジェットコースター殺人事件 Jetto Kōsutā Satsujin Jiken?) is the
		first episode of Detective Conan anime. The anime begins in the middle of a case where a murder
		was committed during a party at a private mansion, introducing the high-school student
		detective Shinichi Kudo who came to solve it. In the next day, he comes with Ran Mouri to
		the Tropical Land where another murder would be committed in a roller-coaster. Being the first
		episode, most of the main characters are introduced throughout the episode. The introduction of
		the characters Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, and Genta are anime-original, as their first manga appearance
		would be only in volume 2.
